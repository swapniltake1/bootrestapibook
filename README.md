# bootrestapibook (Demo Rest API)

My demo book REST API is developed using Spring Boot, a powerful framework for building Java applications. This API allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book data.


The API provides a set of endpoints that can be accessed using HTTP requests. These endpoints follow RESTful principles, allowing you to interact with the book data in a structured and intuitive way.

To test the functionality of the API, I have used Postman, a popular tool for API testing. Postman provides a user-friendly interface for sending requests and receiving responses, making it easier to validate the behavior of the API.

Using Postman, you can send requests to the appropriate endpoints to perform specific operations on the book data. For example, you can use the POST method to create a new book record by providing the necessary details in the request body. The API will process the request and return a response containing the newly created book's information.

Similarly, you can use the GET method to retrieve book records from the API. You can send a GET request to the appropriate endpoint, and the API will return a response containing the requested book data.

Updating and deleting book records can be done using the PUT and DELETE methods, respectively. By sending a PUT request with the updated book details, you can modify an existing record. On the other hand, a DELETE request sent to the API will remove the specified book from the database.

To provide feedback and indicate the success or failure of each operation, the API returns appropriate HTTP status codes. These codes help to indicate whether the request was processed successfully or encountered any errors. For example, a 200 status code indicates a successful request, while a 404 code signifies that the requested resource was not found.

Overall, my demo book REST API built with Spring Boot, along with the use of Postman for testing, allows you to perform CRUD operations on book data efficiently while ensuring proper HTTP status codes are returned to indicate the outcome of each operation.
